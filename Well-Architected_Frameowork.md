## Well-Architected Framework
### The five pillars:

* Operational Excellence
* Security
* Reliability
* Performance Efficiency
* Cost Optimization

### General Design Principles
* Stop guessing your capacity needs
* Test systems at production scale
* Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
* Allow for evolutionary architectures
* Drive architectures using data
* Improve through game days

### Operational Excellence
#### Design Principles
* Perform operations as code
* Annotate documentation
* Make frequent, small, reversible changes
* Refine operations procedures frequently
* Anticipate failure
* Learn from all operational failures

### Definition
